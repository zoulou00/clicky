# Clicky

![Clicky — an ai buddy that lives on your mac](clicky-hero.png)

I built this thing called Clicky.

It's an AI teacher that lives as a buddy next to your cursor. It can see your screen, talk to you, and even point at stuff — kinda like having a real teacher next to you.

I've been using it the past few days to learn Davinci Resolve, 10/10.

Here's the [original tweet](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/2041314633978659092) that kinda blew up.

This is the open-source version of Clicky. If you just want to use it and don't want to mess with code, grab the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/farzaa/clicky/releases).

If you want to hack on it, build your own features, or just see how it works under the hood — keep reading.

## How it works

1. You press **Control + Option** (push-to-talk)
2. Your voice streams in real-time to **AssemblyAI** for transcription
3. When you let go, Clicky screenshots your screen and sends it + your transcript to **Claude**
4. Claude's response streams back and plays out loud via **ElevenLabs** TTS
5. If Claude references something on your screen, the blue cursor flies over and points at it

That's it. No background recording. No saving screenshots. Clicky only looks at your screen the moment you press the hotkey.

## Get started with Claude Code

The fastest way to get this running and start hacking on it is with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). One prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farzaa/clicky.git && cd clicky && claude "Read the CLAUDE.md and get me fully set up. Set up the Cloudflare Worker with my own API keys, update the proxy URLs in the Swift code, and get the app building in Xcode. Walk me through it step by step."
```

Claude will read the codebase, understand the architecture, and walk you through everything. It knows the whole project. You can also just start asking it to build features, fix bugs, whatever. Go crazy.

## Manual setup

If you want to do it yourself, here's the deal.

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.2+ (for ScreenCaptureKit)
- Xcode 15+
- Node.js 18+ (for the Cloudflare Worker)
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (free tier works)
- API keys for: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com), [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com), [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)

### 1. Set up the Cloudflare Worker

The Worker is a tiny proxy that holds your API keys. The app talks to the Worker, the Worker talks to the APIs. This way your keys never ship in the app binary.

```bash
cd worker
npm install
```

Now add your secrets. Wrangler will prompt you to paste each one:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

For the ElevenLabs voice ID, open `wrangler.toml` and set it there (it's not sensitive):

```toml
[vars]
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID = "your-voice-id-here"
```

Deploy it:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

It'll give you a URL like `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`. Copy that.

### 2. Run the Worker locally (for development)

If you want to test changes to the Worker without deploying:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev
```

This starts a local server (usually `http://localhost:8787`) that behaves exactly like the deployed Worker. You'll need to create a `.dev.vars` file in the `worker/` directory with your keys:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...
```

Then update the proxy URLs in the Swift code to point to `http://localhost:8787` instead of the deployed Worker URL while developing. Grep for `clicky-proxy` to find them all.

### 3. Update the proxy URLs in the app

The app has the Worker URL hardcoded in a few places. Search for `your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev` and replace it with your Worker URL:

```bash
grep -r "clicky-proxy" leanring-buddy/
```

You'll find it in:
- `CompanionManager.swift` — Claude chat + ElevenLabs TTS
- `AssemblyAIStreamingTranscriptionProvider.swift` — AssemblyAI token endpoint

### 4. Open in Xcode and run

```bash
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select the `leanring-buddy` scheme (yes, the typo is intentional, long story)
2. Set your signing team under Signing & Capabilities
3. Hit **Cmd + R** to build and run

The app will appear in your menu bar (not the dock). Click the icon to open the panel, grant the permissions it asks for, and you're good.

### Permissions the app needs

- **Microphone** — for push-to-talk voice capture
- **Accessibility** — for the global keyboard shortcut (Control + Option)
- **Screen Recording** — for taking screenshots when you use the hotkey
- **Screen Content** — for ScreenCaptureKit access

## Architecture

If you want the full technical breakdown, read `CLAUDE.md`. But here's the short version:

**Menu bar app** (no dock icon) with two `NSPanel` windows — one for the control panel dropdown, one for the full-screen transparent cursor overlay. Push-to-talk streams audio over a websocket to AssemblyAI, sends the transcript + screenshot to Claude via streaming SSE, and plays the response through ElevenLabs TTS. Claude can embed `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its responses to make the cursor fly to specific UI elements across multiple monitors. All three APIs are proxied through a Cloudflare Worker.

## Project structure

```
leanring-buddy/          # Swift source (yes, the typo stays)
  CompanionManager.swift    # Central state machine
  CompanionPanelView.swift  # Menu bar panel UI
  ClaudeAPI.swift           # Claude streaming client
  ElevenLabsTTSClient.swift # Text-to-speech playback
  OverlayWindow.swift       # Blue cursor overlay
  AssemblyAI*.swift         # Real-time transcription
  BuddyDictation*.swift     # Push-to-talk pipeline
worker/                  # Cloudflare Worker proxy
  src/index.ts              # Three routes: /chat, /tts, /transcribe-token
CLAUDE.md                # Full architecture doc (agents read this)
```

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you're using Claude Code, it already knows the codebase — just tell it what you want to build and point it at `CLAUDE.md`.
